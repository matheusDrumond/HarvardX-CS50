# Harvard CS50 ðŸ“–

This repository is dedicated to documenting all the notes I take during the HarvardX CS50 online course. Concepts and code will be shared as I progress through the course.

Most of the code here is designed to run in [CS50's browser version of VSCode](https://cs50.dev). If you'd like to run the code on your local machine, make sure to download and install the `cs50` library by following [this guide](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/library/c/) for your system.
